add bricks in the Game() constructor

consts are the best
use percentages for screen resolutions

isActive bool in the brick class
	When the ball hits, you set it false, and it doesn't paint
	
Have THIS within for(int j = 0; j > rowsOfBricks; j++)
						{
							for(int i = 0; i > bricksPerRow; i++)
							{
								paint();
								xPos = xPos + brickLength;
							}
							
							yPos = yPos - brickHeigth;
						}
brickHeigth and Legth are consts, made of percentages like the ball

Need to find out how to get the angle the ball hits the paddle, and reverse it properly
